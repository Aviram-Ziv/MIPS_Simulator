A project in Computer Organization and Design at Tel Aviv University. 
The main goal of this project is to simulate the Assembler and the processor. 
As part of the project, we were needed to build 4 test programs, all written in a unique version of Assembly. 
From there, the Assembler will translate the Assembly instructions into binary instructions,
which, in turn, will be executed by the simulator of the processor and all the relevant I/O devices. 

As explained in the description, this project simulates an Assembler program and a processor. 
My part of the project was the creation of the simulator, which is the only code that appears in this repository. 
So, for further clarification - the Assembler part is not in this folder (for it was built by my project partner).

Please note that the project instructions appear in this folder as well under the name "Project instructions", as a PDF file.
These instructions are exactly as they were received from the course instructor and professor.

The files in this folder are the exact library as it was submitted for grading. 
There are 4 text files that are the input files: 
“Diskin.txt”  - represents the initial disk memory image 
“Dmemin.txt” - represents the initial data memory image 
“Imemin.txt” - represents the initial instruction memory image 
“irq2in.txt” - holds the clock cycles in which irq2 will trigger an interrupt

The program can run both as a command line argument or from VS, while manually adding the 4 input arguments above. 

This program has been tested and yielded the exact same results as the different running examples provided by the teaching staff.
